# Sortify - Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Sortify is a beginner-friendly sorting algorithm visualizer that allows users to see how different sorting techniques work in real time. The program supports **Bubble Sort** and **Insertion Sort**, with easy options to switch between **ascending and descending order**. 

## ‚ú® Features
Users can interact with the visualization by:
- **Pressing `SPACE`** to start sorting.
- **Pressing `R`** to reset and generate a new random list.
- **Choosing between Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort** (with an easy way to add more algorithms).
- **Toggling between ascending and descending order sorting**.

This project is designed as a **university semester project for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and is beginner-friendly, making it easy to extend by adding new sorting algorithms.
